   Our experimental setup consists of a UR5e robotic arm, an RGB-D camera, a set of objects placed on the desk in three scenarios: (left) isolated scenario, (center) packed scenario, and (right) pile scenario. The green line denotes the camera’s line of sight.

### This repository 
This repository implements the grasp inference method of Kumra et al. (2020) in a robotic simulation developed in PyBullet. Kumra et al. (2020) propose a generative residual convolutional neural network which predicts one or multiple antipodal grasps using both RGB and depth images of the object scene. Three different grasping scenarios have been implemented. These include objects in isolation, objects packed together, and objects in a pile (Kasaei et al., 2021). 

All code in the directory 'network' is an adaptation of Kumra's open source code that was taken from the following repository: https://github.com/skumra/robotic-grasping  
The simulation code is an adaptation from the following repository: https://github.com/ElectronicElephant/pybullet_ur5_robotiq  
Object models were taken from the following repository: https://github.com/eleramp/pybullet-object-models

## Requirements

Ensure you are running Python>=3.6.5 and import the required libraries by running:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

It will install a set of packages, including: numpy, opencv-python, matplotlib, scikit-image, imageio, torch, torchvision, torchsummary, tensorboardX, pyrealsense2, Pillow, pandas, matplotlib, attrdict, pybullet

## Demo
Running the script 'demo.py' gives a demonstration of the simulation. The demo can be run with three different grasping scenarios. Run 'demo.py --help' to see a full list of options.

Example:
```bash
python demo.py --scenario=isolated --runs=1 --show-network-output=False
```
